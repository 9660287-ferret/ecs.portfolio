	  <h3>My Admirations</h3>
  <ul>
  	 <li>Science has always struck my heart with much interest. The complex biology of organic matter is so extravagant and intriguing, as of right now, I would especially enjoy working as a marine biologist in my future.</li>
 	 <li>I pursue many forms of art including drawing, writing, and archery if that could be considered. I interperet art as a form of expressing emotions, whether it is one's mentality directly translated to paper, or even an enjoyable sport where emotions can be let out through strength.</li>
 	 <li>Ferrets, minks, weaseles, I enjoy all species of the mustelidae family as they are extremely easy to adore and extraordanarily unique compared to any other furry creature. I admire ferrets especially and would often compare them to cats or dogs.</li>
